    Fairy Creek is one of the last unlogged old-growth forests on Vancouver Island. It is a priceless part of Canadian
    biodiversity and natural heritage. The forest should be preserved for future generations, yet it is currently in
    danger. Fairy Creek is being logged by Teal-Jones Group. Only 2.7% of high productivity old-growth BC Forest
    remains, and 75% of those forests have been slated for logging.

    To fight back against the logging of Fairy Creek, protestors have blockaded roads into the forest. This has become
    one of the largest acts of Civil Disobedience in Canadian History. Over 1100 people have been arrested by the RCMP
    at Fairy Creek under a court injunction.
